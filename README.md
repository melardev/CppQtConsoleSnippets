# Introduction
This repository contains Qt C++ snippets NOT related to UI, for UI snippets I have another repository<br>.
I have a lot more snippets, but they have to be refactored before pushing them to Github.<br>
Stay tuned, a lot more will come.

At this moment I publish only the snippets, the project setup will come later, I will give instructions
on how to set this up with the awesome vcpkg and Visual Studio and CMake.
